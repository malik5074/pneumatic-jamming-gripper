# Pneumatic Granular Jamming Gripper

This repository contains the design files and guide for a low-cost pneumatic granular jamming gripper developed for use with teleoperated collaborative robots.

## üß† Project Overview

The gripper uses a latex balloon filled with coffee grounds, vacuum-sealed using a small electric pump to provide adaptive grasping. The modular design supports easy integration with robotic arms such as the Niryo Ned2 and is suitable for educational or research purposes.

## üñ®Ô∏è 3D Printing Instructions

- Print in **PLA** or **PETG**, 20% infill recommended
- Use support for overhangs in the gripper holder
- All parts designed in SolidWorks; STL files provided for direct printing

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Required

- 1x Latex balloon
- Ground coffee (filler)
- Mini vacuum pump
- Pneumatic tubing (6mm)
- Inline air filter
- Small magnet
